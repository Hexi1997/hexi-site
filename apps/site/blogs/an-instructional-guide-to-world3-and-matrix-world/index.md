One of the initial steps you will undertake is to select your avatar for use within Matrix World. The Avatar Editor is here to elevate customization for our users, and offers you an extensive selection of clothing and accessories to bring your avatars to life!

## Enter Matrix World!

Welcome to Matrix World!

Use the **Esc** button to view your cursor and click on the **Map** icon in the corner to get around! The map also includes useful features such as displaying key landmarks and indicating your avatar’s current location, represented by a yellow arrow icon.

When teleporting within Matrix World, you will arrive at a golden spawn point within the chosen land plot. These spawn locations are conveniently positioned on the outer edge of each plot. You’ll soon be able to teleport to the Flow and Ethereum neighbourhoods in the very near future. But currently, you can teleport to and explore everything the Matrix World Flow Downtown has to offer!

## Control Guide

![Image](assets/image_10.png)

As you embark on your journey within WORLD3, let’s take a moment to review the controls to ensure smooth navigation throughout this space. The controls within WORLD3 should feel somewhat familiar if you have previous gaming experience, allowing for natural navigation throughout the world without any difficulties:

- The control scheme adheres to the standard ‘**WASD’** movement configuration: **‘W’** initiates forward movement, **‘A’** initiates leftward movement, **‘S’** initiates backward movement, and **‘D’** initiates rightward movement. You can also use your **Arrow keys** for the same purpose.
- Hold down the **Shift key** to accelerate your movement and change from a walk to a run. To jump, press the **Spacebar**.
- Move your **mouse** to navigate your view and click through your experience. Right-click anywhere on the screen to disengage the camera tracking feature and regain control of your mouse for menu selections.

Other controls include:

- **‘F’** to interact with NPCs and other players.
- **‘U’** to hide HUD.
- **‘I’** to view your inventory.
- ’N’ to hide your username.
- **‘M**’ to view the map.
- **‘Enter’** to chat.
- Press ‘**Esc’** to exit your view and/or view your cursor.

You can also adjust your **Video Quality** and **Audio** settings according to your preferences in the settings.

## Chat

When logged in, users can chat in-world; a dialogue box appears above the avatar’s head when messages are sent. To engage in in-world chat, press **‘Enter’** to activate the chat box located in the bottom-left corner, type your message, and then press **‘Enter’** again to send it. These messages disappear after 5 seconds.

## Explore

_The Matrix World Headquarters is your path to all things fun._

**How To Get There?** Upon entering the **Matrix World Flow Downtown** through the teleportation portal, navigate your Avatar to enter the neighbourhood straight down the first walkway.

The Ethereum 3D Social Exhibition Hall was Matrix World’s first multi-chain pavilion project and located in an Instance Room in the Matrix Universe Building, and users will use an elevator to enter. It aims to provide users with an immersive virtual space to learn about the ETH ecosystem and culture. This space allows users to learn what ETH is, how to create an ETH wallet, how to stake and buy ETH, the history of ETH, the ETH community, ongoing events, and more! Our AI ETH guides will guide users through the entire exhibition hall and answer their questions.

**How to get there?** Press the interactive key **‘F’** in front of the elevator in WORLD3 Headquarters lobby and select **2F** to enter the square of ETH Social Pavilion. The interior of the pavilion can be reached by the beam elevator in the central area.

### University of Alberta
