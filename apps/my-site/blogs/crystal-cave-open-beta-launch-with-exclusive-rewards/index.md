On **September 25, 2024, at 00:00 UTC**, we will conduct an on-chain snapshot of wallets holding SOUL Dragons and WORLD Land, so ensure you own these assets before this date to qualify. All users holding SOUL Dragons and Matrix Lands will be eligible to claim different types of safety helmets.

If you do not own these assets, don’t worry! We’ll be distributing public test qualifications across various communities. You can also complete social media sharing tasks and register your SKALE address for a chance to be selected as a lucky user in an entry qualification airdrop.
